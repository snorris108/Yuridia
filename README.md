just another RPG to help explore and learn Python

I started this RPG the summer before grad school, as I was taking an online introductory python course. Whether you are a seasoned coding professional or beginner like me, please bear this context in mind as you dig through my code. I encourage feedback and interaction, as games have always been a passion of mine, and many of the mechanics implemented here are things I would have liked to see in my many sources of inspiration. Coding is a new passion, and I am very eager to learn everything I can. 
(Even this act is for me to get practice with Github)
Again, please do contact me with any feedback you have, including mistakes I've made, best practices to make my code cleaner or more efficient, or questions you have that I may be able to answer. I welcome anything that can be constructive.

This project is on-going.
